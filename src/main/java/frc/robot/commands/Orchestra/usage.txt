Overall:
Implement the PlaysMusic interface on a subsystem, then pass it into the initialization of an orchestra command.
The orchestra command may then be used as any other command.

PlaysMusic implementation:
The getInstruments() should return all TalonFXs on a subsystem.
The getSubsystems() should return any subsystems that the command should block when using these TalonFXs.
    NOTE: Assuming the interface is being used on a subsystem, this should just return the subsystem which contains it.
